#Dataset and stories for the chatbot
-because I couldnâ€™t find the dataset for Tamil language,I have used for some clothes details from fashion bug business website. And I had to work more on writing own NLU data (approximately more than 400 lines only for NLU data).

-To implement the chatbot I just have used my own stories since, I had some experienced with real world chatbots. 

To improve the bot performance I have written more stories, NLU training data and domain data as well. I have also written some actions for user entries validation. I also had practiced with fallback actions. You can see in the code.
