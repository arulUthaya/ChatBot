# ChatBot
HandsUp chatbot for business websites

I have implemented as The bot can be used to
1.	Order clothes
2.	Cancel the order
3.	Return the order
4.	Refund the payment


Rasa Policies I used, 
1.	TEDPolicy 
    Max history: 5, epochs:200, constrain similarities: true, batch_size:50, max training samples: 300
2.	MemoizationPolicy
    Max history: 7
3.	RulePolicy



Other than this to improve the bot performance I have written more stories, NLU training data and domain data as well. I have also written some actions for user entries validation. I also had practiced with fallback actions. You can see in the code.

because I couldnâ€™t find the dataset for Tamil language. So, I saw the fashion bug business website and I have used for some clothes details. And I had to work more on writing own NLU data (approximately more than 400 lines only for NLU data).
and To implement the chatbot I just have used my own stories since, I had some experienced with real world chatbots.
